# Projects DATA ANALYSIS, DATA SCIENCE and MACHINE LEARNING






## Projects Overview

| Project | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 001     | Explored and analyzed a dataset using the Pandas library in a Colab environment. Focused on observations related to the year 2021, performing operations such as handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and creating new variables. The final organized data was saved in a new Excel file named "seguro-rural-2021.xlsx," providing flexibility for future analyses. |
| 002     | Analyzed rural insurance policies data between 2016 and 2021 using Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Cleaned, organized, and created new variables, followed by statistical and visual analysis. Provided insights into rural insurance policies in 2021, identifying patterns and trends. |
| 003     | Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze Netflix titles data. Created fictional data on average film duration from 2011-2020 and explored a CSV file with real Netflix titles information. Offered comprehensive insights into temporal trends, genre preferences, and geographical distribution of Netflix titles. |
| 004     | Analyzed population-related data using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Explored a user-provided CSV file, visualizing population distribution by region and income group. Provided clear visual insights into population composition across regions and income strata. |
| 005     | Analyzed the latest population census data using Pandas. Explored data integrity, type conversion, and created a histogram for the distribution of the "Latest population census" variable. Offered a visually interpretable representation of the population census distribution. |
| 006     | Analyzed Data Science jobs data using Pandas. Explored data statistics, removed duplicates, and created visualizations, including a histogram of salary distribution. Provided insights into salary distribution and trends in Data Science jobs. |
| 007     | Explored Data Science job data, including salary distribution, job category boxplots, and temporal analysis. The second part focused on job title classification using Naive Bayes. Demonstrated data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning implementation in the Colab environment. |
| 008     | Similar to Project 007, exploring Data Science job data and Naive Bayes classification. Continued demonstration of data handling, visualization, and machine learning in the Colab environment. |
| 009     | Analyzed skills data for different professions using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud. Visualized the top skills associated with each profession. Provided a quick overview of the most relevant skills for various job categories. |
| 010     | Developed, optimized, and managed Linear Regression models using Scikit-Learn and MLflow. Integrated with MLflow for metric and parameter tracking. Visualized the training process and evaluated model performance, demonstrating the integration with MLflow. |
| 011     | Focused on data treatment in Excel, emphasizing efficient handling of web-sourced information. Highlighted essential techniques for organizing and manipulating data for improved subsequent analyses.  |
| 012     | Explored and applied various essential Excel formulas and functions for data analysis. Emphasized practical application for creating a dashboard-like report. Demonstrated the versatility of Excel functions for day-to-day analyses and professional contexts. |
| 013     | This Python project analyzes a dataset of unicorn companies using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It includes loading the dataset, exploring its structure, visualizing null values, and examining columns like 'Industry' and 'Country.' The analysis provides insights into the distribution of unicorn companies across industries and countries. Additionally, the project involves date processing, creating visualizations to enhance understanding and support data-driven decision-making.|
